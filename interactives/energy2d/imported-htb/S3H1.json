  "about": "Try building your own wall using the objects provided. The conductor has\nten times the conductivity of the insulator. You can reshape them by\nclicking on them and dragging the small yellow rectangles. Make sure\nthat the pieces touch each other and bridge all the way from the heater\non the left to the object to be heated on the right.\n\nYou can build different walls by:\n\n* moving the boxes around and changing their width and length (use your\n  mouse to do this);\n* copying and then pasting a box to create another one with the same\n  properties (right-click, or control-click on the Mac, on an object to\n  do this. You can then move and resize the new object.);\n* making a sandwich of several layers in series;\n* making parallel connectors with different conductivities.\n\n(For instance, imagine that the wall consists of insulation with an\noccasional metal stud that forms a bridge through the insulation between\nthe inside and outside.)\n\nYou can place the extra thermometers anywhere you like if you want to\nmeasure the temperatures inside the wall.\n\nBuild at least two different walls in the middle space and compare their\nrates of heat flow. You can compare two walls by turning on the graph,\nrunning the model for a minute, and noting the temperature of the\nright-hand object.\n\n**For Windows users: Take a screenshot of your wall using the \\\"Print\nScreen\\\" key on your keyboard (you may hold down the Ctrl key), paste\ninto the Paint program and save it as an image file in your folder.**\n\nThen answer the questions in your workbook.\n\n",
