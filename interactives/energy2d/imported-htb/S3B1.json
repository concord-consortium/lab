  "about": "The rate of heat conduction depends on the thermal conductivity of the\nmaterial (*k*), as described in the formula below:\n\n\n\n| Δ*Q*/Δ*t* = -<font color=\"red\">***k****A*Δ*T*/*L* </font>\n\n |\n{: cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"0\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"}\n\n(This formula says that heat transfer rate is proportional to thermal\nconductivity. See the Workbook for the meanings of the math symbols.)\n\nThis model has two situations for you to compare. On the left are two\nseparate heat sources with a constant temperature (50°C). On the right\nare two separate objects with a thermometer, which measures how much\nheat has been conducted. The left-hand side and right-hand side objects\nare connected by two test pieces that differ in only thermal\nconductivity (*k*). **Your task is to tell which test piece has higher\nthermal conductivity.**\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n4.  Click a thermometer to highlight its temperature curve.\n\nAfter you have observed the model, answer the questions in your\nworkbook.\n\n",
