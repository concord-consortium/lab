  "subtitle": "Why does the temperature in a box change more dramatically than the temperature in the other?",
  "about": "Two closed boxes have identical heaters but the heat capacity of the\nleft-hand box is much greater than the heat capacity of the right-hand\nbox. The power switch controls both heaters.\n\n1.  Run the model and turn the graph on to monitor the temperatures.\n    Click on a thermometer to highlight its data.\n2.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n3.  When the **left-hand side box** reaches 5°C, turn off the power.\n4.  Try to keep the temperature in the **left-hand side box** between 3\n    and 5°C by turning the power on and off.\n5.  Compare the shapes of the two temperature curves.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
