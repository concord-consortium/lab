  "about": "A thermostat is a controller that maintains a system\\'s temperature near\na fixed point. The simplest thermostat does this by switching a heater\nor AC on and off to maintain the desired temperature. The following\nmodel simulates a thermostat that uses a temperature sensor to control a\nheater. Turn on the temperature graph. Let the simulation run for a few\ncycles and then turn on the sunlight. Compare the behavior of the\ntemperature graph. You can also try to move the temperature sensor to\nexamine how the on/off time of the thermostat depends on its location.\n\n",
