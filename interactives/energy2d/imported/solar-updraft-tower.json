  "about": "The solar updraft tower is a clean energy power plant for generating\nelectricity from the sun. Sunshine falling on a greenhouse collector\nstructure around the base of a tall chimney heats the air within it. The\nresulting convection causes air to rise up in the tower, driving wind\nturbines to produce electricity. In December 2011, Hyperion Energy\nannounced that it would build a solar updraft tower in Arizona that\nwould rival the height of the tallest building in the world!\n\nRight-click these links to download the models:  \n [solar-updraft-tower.e2d](e2d/solar-updraft-tower.e2d),\n[solar-updraft-tower2.e2d](e2d/solar-updraft-tower2.e2d),\n[solar-updraft-tower3.e2d](e2d/solar-updraft-tower3.e2d)\n{: align=\"center\"}\n\n",
