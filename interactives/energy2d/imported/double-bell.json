  "about": "A [rocket stove][1] mass heater is an innovative and efficient space\nheating system. Multiple small bells are effective in heat extraction\nthan a single big bell, the total volume can be smaller too. They can be\narranged in many ways, at the side or on top of another. The top\narrangement is used to place a baking oven in one of them. The following\nsimulation is a double-bell model designed by Martin Karl Waldenburg\nfrom Germany.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_stove \n",
