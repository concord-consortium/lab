  "about": "The Neumann boundary condition is the second type of boundary condition\nthat defines the gradients on the border of the problem domain (the\ngradient at a spot along the border describes how much the value across\nthe boundary changes). In the following simulation, you can set heat\nfluxes through different borders and see how this boundary condition\nwill affect the temperature distribution inside the box.\n\n",
