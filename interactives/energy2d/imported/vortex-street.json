  "about": "The term vortex street (also known as von Kármán vortex street) is used\nin fluid dynamics to describe a repeating pattern of swirling vortices\ncaused by the unsteady separation of flow over obstacles. This\nsimulation shows that the formation of a vortex street depends on the\ndiameter of the obstacle.\n\n",
