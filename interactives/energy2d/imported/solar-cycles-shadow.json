  "about": "This simulation compares the solar heating under the sun and in the\nshade using two temperature sensors. The simulation starts at 12am and\nassumes that the sun rises at 4am and sets at 20pm. Note that in the\nfirst few seconds you may not see any sun beams. Just wait for a while\nuntil the sun shines in.\n\n",
