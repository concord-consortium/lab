      <p align="left">That means there is a limit to how much you can increase the temperature to make a reaction happen faster. As long as you don't heat it to the point where you start to break down the bonds of what you are trying to make, increasing temperature will help the reaction happen faster. However, go too high, and you work against the reaction you are trying to make happen.</p></td>
