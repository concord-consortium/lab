  <font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In ionic compounds one or more electrons are transfered from one atom<br> 
  to another, forming ions that have an integer value for charge (<em>ex.</em> +1 or -2).<br> 
  In covalent bonds the electrons are shared unevenly, not transferred, which <br>
  results in a surface chage that is a fractional value (<em>ex.</em> +0.35 or -0.47). </font>
