<text>Molecular surface object


Molecular surface is the surface which an external probe-sphere touches as it is rolled over the atoms of the molecule (F. M. Richards: Areas, volumes, packing and protein structure, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioengg., 6, 151-176, 1977). Molecular surface is a useful concept in studying protein structure and interactions.

In Molecular Workbench, a Molecular Surface Object is a convenience model that defines an area atoms and molecules (such as water) do not usually penetrate into [1].

[1] To build useful models for molecular biology without having to use full ball-and-stick representations of macromolecules, interacting objects that have arbitrary shapes are needed.

Recognizing the difficulty in deriving an analytical model for interacting particles in arbitrary shapes that is also computationally efficient, we took a different approach. We developed a drawing tool in Molecular Workbench, which permits users to draw arbitrary non-self-intersected open and closed shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, cubic splines, or free-form lines. When the user finishes drawing a shape, Lennard-Jones particles with appropriate size are automatically aligned along the line (if the shape is open), or along the border (if the shape is closed), to its full length. After the particle alignment is done, harmonic forces are used to connect the aligned Lennard-Jones particles in radial and angular directions, to combine them into a single object. Such an object has a van der Waals surface that can attract (and be attracted to) other similar objects or Lennard-Jones particles. It has also a border that is formed by the repulsive core of the Lennard-Jones potential to prevent overlaps with another object or a Lennard-Jones particle. If an atomic probe were used to scan over the border, an enveloping shape would be obtained, because the repulsive cores bounce back the probe. In molecular biology, such an enveloping shape generated by a real or hypothetical probe is called a molecular surface (e.g. electronic density map by a scanning tunneling microscope or solvent accessible surface by a hypothetical solvent molecule). Hence, we call this type of object the molecular surface object.

The following image shows the scanning results of equi-potential contours of a molecular surface object using a Lennard-Jones particle as a probe:
