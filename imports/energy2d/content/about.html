    <h1>Energy2D</h1>
    <p>Bringing Powerful Scientific and Engineering Simulations to Your Classroom</p>
  </div>

    <h1>Vision</h1>


<p><a href="http://www.wtec.org/sbes/">Simulation-based engineering science (SBES)</a> 
is increasingly important in accelerating research and development in engineering 
because of the analytical power and cost effectiveness of computer simulation. Advanced simulation tools based on solving basic 
equations in physics, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">the Navier-Stokes equation</a>
for modeling fluid dynamics, are routinely used to tackle complex engineering problems and to search for optimal solutions in many 
engineering practices, ranging from microelectromechanical devices to Mars rovers. Representing the application of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> 
in engineering, SBES is an interdisciplinary subject indispensable to the nation's continued leadership in science and technology.


<p>SBES, however, has virtually no place in the current engineering or science curricula at the secondary level. Nor is there an agenda 
to introduce it, to the best of our knowledge. Despite the fact that modern simulation tools can run on an ordinary computer and be used 
without having to know how the computational engine actually works, it is still commonly thought that SBES mandates advanced mathematics 
and science, uses abstruse jargon, requires monster supercomputers, works only through the esoteric command line, and cannot be possibly 
taught or used at secondary level. As a result, most pre-college students are not exposed to this modern engineering methodology and are 
deprived of an opportunity to develop interest in it earlier in their education. The consequence of this deficiency may have contributed 
to the erosion of the nation's leadership in SBES and engineering science in general.

<p>In 2009, <a href="http://www.concord.org/~qxie">Dr. Charles Xie</a> 
wrote a proposal "Enhancing Engineering Education with Computational Thinking" to the National Science Foundation 
to address this problem. The proposal was <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0918449">awarded</a>, 
which allowed Energy2D to be developed. To date, Energy2D has been used by tens of thousands of students worldwide, ranging from
middle schools to top-notch universities.

<h2>People's Reactions</h2>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;This is an amazing tool!! I'm working in education - guiding high school students through physics projects. This is the best computer based tool I have found so far! 
I'm using Matlab and Mathematica a lot, but for the students (and for me too!) this is a simple, intuitive and fast way to check out ideas and learn from intuition and not only from equations.
Again, thanks a lot for sharing this, it is amazing! It will help my students and myself a lot.&rdquo;
<em>&#8212; from Israel</em></li>

<br>

<li>&ldquo;I read your article in the Physics Teacher and I'm just now exploring the program. What a great simulation! Thanks a lot on behalf of the whole community.&rdquo;
<em>&#8212; from Germany</em></li>

<br>

<li>&ldquo;Thank you very much for this wonderful program. It is great for science education!&rdquo;
