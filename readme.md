## Distribution of Project and Examples

Compressed archives of the generated Lab distribution are available for download:

- [Lab distribution (tar.gz archive)](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab/tarball/gh-pages) _(32MB)_
- [Lab distribution (zip archive)](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab/zipball/gh-pages) _(42MB)_

Download and expand one of these archives to create a folder named `concord-consortium-lab-xxxxxxx`.
The seven characters at the end of the archive filename are the first seven characters of the git
commit SHA.

Open the file index.html in this folder in your browser to get an offline version of the Lab
project.

Features that require integration of the back-end web application such as saving changes
in models and interactives and use of Java applets do not work directly from a downloaded distribution.

**NOTE:** the downloaded distribution of examples may *not* work properly
in Chrome due to a long-standing bug in Chrome:
[Issue 49001: Regression: cssRules null when stylesheets loaded from local disk](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=49001).
The problem only occurs when loading the web pages directly from your filesystem. If instead you
use a local web server on your computer to serve the downloaded distribution Chrome works properly.

## Setup Development

Lab uses a number of RubyGems and node modules to manage development. Lab's test framework
uses [Vows](http://vowsjs.org), which depends on [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and
[npm](http://npmjs.org/) (Node Package Manager). In addition JavaScript minification is
done using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

### Prerequisites:

#### RVM, Ruby 1.9 and the RubyGem bundler

We use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to mange our development dependency on [Ruby 1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
and the specific Ruby Gems needed for building Lab and running the Lab server.

1. [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/)

After installation you should see something like the following:

    $  ruby -v
    ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin10.8.0]

Once you have a working version of Ruby 1.9.3 check to see if the RubyGem [bundler](http://gembundler.com/)
is already installed:

    $ gem list bundler

    *** LOCAL GEMS ***

    bundler (1.1.3)

If Bundler is not installed install it now:

    $ gem install bundler
    Fetching: bundler-1.1.3.gem (100%)
    Successfully installed bundler-1.1.3
    1 gem installed

#### nodejs and npm, the Node Package Manager

[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/), the Node Package Manager are additional
development dependencies.

[npm](http://npmjs.org/), the Node Package Manager has been included as part of [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
since version 0.6.3.

Install the latest stable version of node (currently v0.6.18) with installers available here: [http://nodejs.org/#download](http://nodejs.org/#download)

Currently development is being done with these versions of node and npm:

    $ node -v
    v0.6.18

    $ npm -v
    1.1.21

#### CouchDB

Install the nosql document-oriented [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) database server to support persistence for the Lab server.

Installation options:

**MacOS X**

Most of the developers on Lab use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) a package manager for Mac OS X.

1. [Install Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation)
2. Install CouchDB using homebrew

        brew doctor     # fix issues if needed
        brew update     # if you haven't run it in the last 24 hours
        brew install couchdb

###Linux
Before any of this make sure that "run command as login shell" is checked. if it isn't go to edit-profile preferences-Title and Command, and check Run command as a login shell.

to [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) you need to have curl:
<pre><code> $  sudo apt-get install curl </code></pre>

then install RVM using curl with:
<pre><code> $ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby </code></pre>

After RVM has finnished installing it will ask you to run a command similar to 
<pre><code>$ source /home/user_name/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code></pre>    

After installation you should see something like the following:

    $  ruby -v
    ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-linux]

RVM has some additional dependancies, to view these type:
<pre><code>$ rvm requirements</code></pre>

under additional dependancies and ruby, copy the list of dependancies and paste them in to your terminal emediatly preceading sudo, it should look something like this:

<pre><code>sudo /usr/bin/apt-get install build-essential openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake libtool bison subversion</code></pre>

Becouse of some unknown bugs RVM doesn't recognise readline without being explictly pointed to it, to do this you have to reinstall ruby 1.9.3-p194.
<pre><code>$ rvm reinstall 1.9.3-p194 --with-zlib1g-dev</code></pre>

[ruby gem bundler](http://gembundler.com/) should be installed, to check if it has been try:

    $ gem list bundler

    *** LOCAL GEMS ***

    bundler (1.1.4)
if it doesn't return anything you can try:

 <pre><code>$  gem install bundler</code></pre>


#### nodejs and npm and couchdb

[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/), the Node Package Manager are additional
development dependencies.

[npm](http://npmjs.org/), the Node Package Manager has been included as part of [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
since version 0.6.3.

The nosql document-oriented [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) database server is installed to support persistence for the Lab server.

To install the latest stable versions of node and couchdb you first need to add repositories ([node repo](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/node.js/)  and [couchdb repo](https://launchpad.net/~longsleep/+archive/couchdb) ) with the most recent versions. for these to work as intended python software properties must also be installed.

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js 
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:longsleep/couchdb
$ sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

then you can simply install using apt-get

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install couchdb nodejs npm</code></pre>

Currently development is being done with these versions of node and npm:

    $ node -v
    v0.6.18

    $ npm -v
    1.1.21

neither the java run time environment nor the java development kit are installed by default, both of which are used for the java proects.
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install  default-jre openjdk-6-jdk </code></pre>


nokogiri requires libxslt and libxml2, install them with:
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev</code></pre>

final note, before you "make everything" after cloning the git repo run 
<pre><code>cp config/config_sample.yml config/config.yml</code></pre>


### Use git to create a local clone of the Lab repository.

If you have commit access to the repository use this form:

    git clone git@github.com:concord-consortium/lab.git

Alternatively if you don't have commit access use this form:

    git clone git://github.com/concord-consortium/lab.git

### Setup the local Lab repository for development

Make sure you have already installed the prerequistes: [Ruby 1.9](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
the RubyGem [bundler](http://gembundler.com/), and [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) (which now includes
[npm](http://npmjs.org/) the Node Package Manager.

Open a shell and change to the `lab/` directory. The first time you `cd` into the `lab/` directory RVM will
ask you if this *new* `.rvmrc` file should be trusted.

The `.rvmrc` specifies that this project dependeds on Ruby 1.9.3-p194 and all the required Ruby Gems
will be installed in the RVM gemset named `ruby-1.9.3-p194@lab`.

    cd lab
    make everything

When `make everything` is run on a freshly cloned repository it performs the following tasks:

1.  Install the runtime dependencies as git submodules into the `vendor/` directory:

        git submodule update --init --recursive

2.  Install the development dependencies that use [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and
    are managed by [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

        npm install

    You can see the list of dependencies to be installed in the file `package.json`. In addition
    `vendor/d3` and `vendor/science.js` are manually installed into `node_modules/`.

3.  Install the additional RubyGems used for development: haml, sass, guard ...

        bundle install --binstubs

    This creates the `bin/` directory and populates it with command-line executables for running
    the specific versions of the RubyGems installed for development.

4.  Generates the `server/public` directory:

5.  Generates the Java resources in the `server/public/jnlp` directory:

You should now be able to open the file: `server/public/index.html` in a browser and run some of the examples.

#### Automatic build processing using Guard

Start watching the `src/` and `test/` directories with [Guard](#guard) and when files are
changed automatically generate the JavaScript Lab modules, the examples, and run the tests.

    bin/guard

Now any change you make in `src/examples/` will generate the corresponding content in `server/public/examples/`.
In addition changes in `src/lab/` generate the associated Lab modules in `lab/` and copy these modules
to `server/public/lab/`. In addition any change in either the `src/lab/` or `test/`directories will run the
tests and display the results in the console window where `bin/guard`
is running.

#### Setup the Rails Lab server for development

The Lab server is a very simple Rails 3.2 application that uses CouchDB for persistence.

Open a shell and change to the `lab/server` directory. The first time you `cd` into the `lab/server` directory RVM will
ask you if this *new* `.rvmrc` file should be trusted.

The `.rvmrc` specifies that this project dependeds on Ruby 1.9.3-p194-server and all the required Ruby Gems
will be installed in the RVM gemset named `ruby-1.9.3-p194@lab-server`.

    cd lab/server
    bundle install

Create a couchdb configuration by copying the sample:

    cp config/couchdb.sample.yml config/couchdb.yml

If you have setup your local CouchDB server to require admin login for creating new databases
you will need to enter user and password for a valid admin user.

##### Starting the Rails Lab server

    cd lab/server
    thin start

You can now open your local Lab application at this url:

    http://localhost:3000/

You can use a pre-configured route to open the local CouchDb admin web interface:

    http://localhost:3000/_utils

##### Entering the Rails Lab server console

    cd lab/server
    rails console

#### Building the Legacy Java applications and the Sensor Java Applet

The Lab repository can build the legacy Java applications Molecular Workbench and Energy2D we
are converting to HTML5.

Building these Java applications allows developers to more easily compare the operation
of the HTML5 versions of these applications to the Java versions running in he browser as applets.

In addition we can create the Java resources to run the invisible Java applet needed for communicating
with Vernier GoIO probware in the browser however the Java resources for communicating with the
Vernier GoIO Probeware need to be digitally signed.

##### Java Code-Signing Certificate and Keystore

A self-signed Java certificate is included with the Lab repository: `config/lab-sample-keystore,jks`
with a password and private key password of *abc123* however for production use you will want to use
a keystore with a publically-recognized Java code-siging certificate from a company like
[Thawte](http://www.thawte.com/code-signing/index.html).

To build the Jar resources for the probeware using either the self-signed certificate provided
with the Lab repository or one of your own first create the file `config/config.yml` by
copying `config/config.sample.yml` and editing appropriately.

    cp config/config.sample.yml config/config.yml

The `:java:` section of the `config.yml` yaml file looks like this:

    ---
    # password and alias for Java siging certificate.
    :java:
      :password: abc123
      :alias: lab-sample-keystore
      :keystore_path: config/lab-sample-keystore.jks

If you have a keystore already accessible via an alias replace `lab-sample-keystore` with
the alias for your existing keystore. If your keystore is stored in your home directory in the
file `.keystore` then you do should leave the `:keystore_path` empty.

    :keystore_path:

The self-signed `lab-sample-keystore,jks` keystore was generated with the Java keytool command as follows:

    $ keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore config/lab-sample-keystore,jks -alias lab-sample-keystore -storepass abc123 -validity 360 -keysize 2048
    What is your first and last name?
      [Unknown]:  Stephen Bannasch
    What is the name of your organizational unit?
      [Unknown]:  Lab Project
    What is the name of your organization?
      [Unknown]:  Concord Consortium
    What is the name of your City or Locality?
      [Unknown]:  Concord
    What is the name of your State or Province?
      [Unknown]:  Massachusetts
    What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
      [Unknown]:  US
    Is CN=Stephen Bannasch, OU=Lab Project, O=Concord Consortium, L=Concord, ST=Massachusetts, C=US correct?
      [no]:  yes
    Enter key password for <lab-sample-keystore>
    	(RETURN if same as keystore password):

    $ keytool -selfcert -alias lab-sample-keystore -keystore config/lab-sample-keystore.jks
    Enter keystore password:

##### Building the Java Resources

Run `make jnlp-all` to erase, build, package, sign and deploy all the Java resurces.

The first time this task is run it:

1.  Creates a `java/` top-level directory and checks out the required Java projects into this directory.
2.  Builds each of the projects
3.  Copies the jar resources into the `server/public/jnlp/` directory packing and signing them as needed.

Later if you have made updates in the Java source code or need to re-build and deploy for any reason you
can run:

    script/build-and-deploy-jars.rb --maven-update

If one of the maven projects fails to build because a dependency could not be found try running
the command again with the `--maven-update` argument:

    script/build-and-deploy-jars.rb --maven-update

Details about each project, where the repository is located, what branch is compiled, what specific
compilation details are all contained in `config/java-projects.rb/`.

#### Java build/deploy integration

There is a configuration file expressed in Ruby code here `config/java-projects.rb` for all the
Java projects that will be checked-out, built, packed, signed if neede, and deployed.

In this configuration file projects are specified like this:

    'otrunk'         => { :repository => 'git://github.com/concord-consortium/otrunk.git',
                          :branch => 'trunk',
                          :path => 'org/concord/otrunk',
                          :build_type => :maven,
                          :build => MAVEN_STD_CLEAN_BUILD,
                          :has_applet_class => true,
                          :sign => true },

The 'trunk' branch of this repo will be checked out into ./java/otrunk and will be built using Maven.
Becuase the otrunk jar is used with the sensor-applet code it must be signed.

##### Java Projects Build Strategies

The `:build_type` option is used to specify the  Java Projects Build Strategy
Four different kinds of build strategies can be used. Each strategy includes
additional build information in the `:build` option.

1. `:maven`
2. `:ant`
3. `:custom`
4. `:copy_jars`

For Energy2D a `:custom` build strategy is used and the command line invocation necessary is in the
`MANUAL_JAR_BUILD` constant.

  'energy2d'       => { :repository => 'git://github.com/concord-consortium/energy2d.git',
                        :branch => 'trunk',
                        :path => 'org/concord/energy2d',
                        :build_type => :custom,
                        :version => '0.1.0',
                        :build => MANUAL_JAR_BUILD,
                        :has_applet_class => true,
                        :sign => false },

The script that runs the checkout-build-pack-sign-deploy can either operate on ALL projects specified or on a smaller number.

Running `script/build-and-deploy-jars.rb` with no arguments operates on all projects listed in config/java-projects.rb.

Optionally you can specify one or more projects to operate on. This builds just sensor and sensor-applets:

    script/build-and-deploy-jars.rb sensor sensor-applets

The deployed resources have a timestamp in the deployed artifact so unless you specifically request an earlier version you will always get the latest deployed version.

##### JnlpApp Rack Application Service

The Rails server has a Rack application `JnlpApp` mounted at the route `/jnlp` for servicing requests for Java jar resources.

The `JnlpApp` Rack application uses the `Rack::Jnlp` middleware defined here `server/lib/rack/jnlp.rb`.

Normally versions for jars can only be specified by using a jnlp form. A jnlp form of specification can be used for webstart and also for applets.

The older form of applet invocation that uses the <applet> html element normally can't specify version numbers for jar dependencies, however the Jnlp::Rack application included with Lab does allow version specification.

Example: right now on my local system there are two different versions of the vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar.jar:

    $ ls -l server/public/jnlp/org/concord/sensor/vernier/vernier-goio/vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar*
      98396 May 28 01:55 ../org/concord/sensor/vernier/vernier-goio/vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar__V1.5.0-20101012.203835-2.jar
      99103 May 28 16:40 ../org/concord/sensor/vernier/vernier-goio/vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar__V1.5.0-20120528.164030-3.jar

Note the different lengths for the two different versions.

If a request comes in from Java for vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar.jar the most recent version is returned:

    $ curl --user-agent java -I http://localhost:3000/jnlp/org/concord/sensor/vernier/vernier-goio/vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar.jar
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Last-Modified: Mon, 28 May 2012 20:40:34 GMT
    Content-Type: application/java-archive
    Content-Length: 99103

However the version number can be added as a http query parameter.

    $ curl --user-agent java -I http://localhost:3000/jnlp/org/concord/sensor/vernier/vernier-goio/vernier-goio-macosx-x86_64-nar.jar?version-id=1.5.0-20101012.203835-2
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Last-Modified: Mon, 28 May 2012 05:55:05 GMT
    Content-Type: application/java-archive
    Content-Length: 98396
    x-java-jnlp-version-id: 1.5.0-20101012.203835-2

Note that in the response the x-java-jnlp-version-id HTTP header is added with teh actual version.

This feature of specifying versioned jar resources should NOT be used for production because Java won't properly cache the jar locally. Eveytime a request is made for a jar with a version-id query parameter the complete jar will be downloaded again.

When a version is specified in a jnlp form for an applet the jar WILL be cached properly.

**Development Note**: If the applets no longer operate properly it may be that the server is no longer operating properly
and needs to be restarted. The Java console log for the applet may show requests made for jars that are not fulfilled.

If a request like the following produces an error:

    $ curl --user-agent java -I http://localhost:3000/jnlp/org/concord/sensor-native/sensor-native.jar
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

Restart the server and the request should now suceed:

    $ curl --user-agent java -I http://localhost:3000/jnlp/org/concord/sensor-native/sensor-native.jar
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Last-Modified: Thu, 07 Jun 2012 16:44:28 GMT

    Content-Length: 34632
    content-encoding: pack200-gzip
    
## Contributing to Lab

If you think you'd like to contribute to Lab as an external developer:

1. Create a local clone from the repository located here: http://github.com/concord-consortium/lab.
   This will by default have the git-remote name: **origin**.

2. Make a fork of http://github.com/concord-consortium/lab to your account on github.

3. Make a new git-remote referencing your fork. I recommend making the remote name your github user name.
   For example my username is `stepheneb` so I would add a remote to my fork like this:

        git remote add stepheneb git@github.com:stepheneb/lab.git

4. Create your changes on a topic branch. Please include tests if you can. When your commits are ready
   push your topic branch to your fork and send a pull request.

## Continuous Integration on travis-ci

[travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org) is a free open-source web-based distributed continuous integration system.

When code is checked in to the master branch the [concord-consortium/lab](http://travis-ci.org/#!/concord-consortium/lab)
project on [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org) automatically runs all the unit tests.

If any test fails the author of the commit will get an email as well the developers listed in the
[.travis.yml](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab/blob/master/.travis.yml) configuration file.

### Setting up travis-ci integration

I created an account on [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org) linked to the [stepheneb](https://github.com/stepheneb)
acocunt on github by having travis-ci authenticate me with github using oauth.

I was then able to manually setup a Travis service hook for the lab repository. I needed to
do this manually because I was integrating a repository under the concord-consortium github
organization instead of one directly under my own account.

## Measuring Performance

The [Complex Atoms Model](http://lab.dev.concord.org/examples/complex-atoms-model/complex-atoms-model.html)
includes several features for estimating and measuring performance of the molecular modeler.

1. End of **Stats** section displays average number of model steps/s.

2. **Run Benchmarks** button stops model and measures time for running the model
   100 steps and also time for running the model and rendering the graphics for 100
   steps. When measuring the speed of the model and graphics together the test is run
   continuously and control is *not* returned to the browser for repainting the screen.

3. A separate [lab.performance](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab) repository with a
   Ruby script [performance.rb](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab) available which
   uses Selenium Webdriver to automate running the **Run Benchmarks** test 10 times and
   collects , averages, and reports the results.

### Installing and using `performance.rb`

We use a completely separate repository for the performance monitoring tools so the
same performance mesuring scripts can be used to measure performance over a range of
commits to the Lab project. This  makes it easier to monitor performance and investigate
performance regressions.

In your working copy of the Lab project:

    git checkout git://github.com/concord-consortium/lab.performance.git

Edit paths in the file `lab.performance/performance.rb` to reference locations for FireFox and Chrome
on your computer as well as the variable `URL_TO_COMPLEX_MODEL` for running the
[Complex Atoms Model](http://lab.dev.concord.org/examples/complex-atoms-model/complex-atoms-model.html)
locally.

Gem prequisites: [selenium-webdriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings)

## Repository structure

### Summary of Directories in `src/`

#### `src/lab`

The **`src/lab`** directory includes JavaScript source code for the Lab JavaScript modules.
During the build process individual files are copied into modules which are placed in
the **`server/public/lab`** directory.

#### `src/examples/`, `src/doc/`, and `src/experiments/`

The **`src/examples/`**, **`src/doc/`**, and **`src/experiments/`** directories contain additional
resources for generating the html, css, and image resources for the matching target
folders in **`server/public`**.

**Note:** remember to make changes you want saved in the **`src/examples/`**, **`src/doc/`**,
and **`src/experiments/`** and not in the target directories of the same names in
**`server/public`**. Change made in **`server/public`** will be overwritten during the next
build process.

#### `src/vendor`

[Third-party JavaScript runtime dependencies](#javascript-library-runtime-dependencies)
for Lab are located in the **`src/vendor`** directory and are installed as git submodules
the first time `make` is run in a new checkout of the source code repository.

Only the necessary JavaScript library files and other resources needed for runtime operation along
with the associated README and LICENSE files are copied to **`server/public/vendor`** during
the build process.

All of the files copied to **`server/public/vendor`** are licensed and distributed under
one or more of the following licenses: [Simplified BSD](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause),
[The BSD 3-Clause](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause),
[MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT), or
[Apache 2.0](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).

#### `src/resources`

The **`src/resources`** directory contains image resources and are copied directly to
**`server/public/resources`**.

#### `src/sass`

The **`src/sass`** directory contains Sass templates and the Bourbon Sass library are are used
during the build process to generate CSS resources.

#### `src/mw-helpers`

The **`src/mw-helpers`** directory contains JavaScript modules only used as part of the testing and
build process and are not copied to **`server/public/resources`**.

#### `src/jnlp`

The **`src/jnlp`** directory currently contains the Vernier GoIO Java sensor Jars. While these
files are needed to use Vernier GoIO sensor in the browser normally there are no compiled
artifacts included in either the Lab repository or referenced and used by the Lab either
as external git submodules or as separately downloaded Java projects. The presence of these
specific files is temporary until I can recreate or redevelop the specifc combination of Java,
Vernier GoIO native libraries and JNI code generated by SWIG used 18 months ago to create
these resources at Concord Consortium.

### Lab Modules: `src/lab`

The source code for the Lab modules is all contained in **`src/lab`**

- `src/lab/models`
- `src/lab/views`
- `src/lab/controllers`
- `src/lab/grapher`
- `src/lab/arrays`
- `src/lab/benchmark`
- `src/lab/components`
- `src/lab/layout`

These JavaScript fragments are used in the build process:

- `src/lab/start.js`
- `src/lab/lab-module.js`
- `src/lab/end.js`

The **`energy2d-module.js`** represents a new way of creating modules used by the Energy2D model engine.

- `src/lab/energy2d-module.js`

### Lab Modeling Engines: `src/lab/models`

#### 2D Molecular Dynamics: `md2d`

The source code of the core molecular dynamics engine is currently located in the `src/md-engine`
directory, which is organized as a set of related Node modules. The entry point for external
applications is the file `src/md-engine/md2d.js`.

A build step uses the [`node-browserify`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) Node module
to convert this entry point and all its dependencies into a single JavaScript file located at `md-
engine/md2d.js`. Another build step automatically appends this browser-compatible version to the
beginning of the `lab.molecules.js` file.

This means that the global function `require()` is defined at the beginnig of `lab.molecules.js`,
and can be used by any code that runs after that point to obtain the modeler defined in `md2d.js`
and its dependencies. The argument to `require()` should be written as if one were using Node with a
current working directory of `src/md-engine`, e.g., in a web application that includes
`lab.molecules.js`, write `var md2d = require('./md2d');` to get a reference to the modeler.

In addition, Node-based executables can be written and placed in `src/md-engine` or a subdirectory.
These are expected to be useful for verifying and tuning the model by running the model headless and
saving summary results into a file for offline analysis; see, e.g., [https://github.com/rklancer
/script-md](https://github.com/rklancer/script-md).

Hashbang scripts for starting these executables (i.e., files which start with the line
`#!/usr/bin/env node` and which have the execute bit set) should be placed in the directory `node-
bin`, and should execute by `require()`ing the appropriate module and calling its entry point
method. Lab's `package.json` file specifies `node-bin/` as the location of the executable scripts
which `npm` should make available whenever Lab is imported into another project as a Node module.
(For developer convenience, `bin/` is being reserved for Ruby executables made available via
Bundler.)

#### 2D Thermal Energy: `energy2d`

### Lab Views: `src/lab/views`

### Lab Controllers: `src/lab/controllers`

### Adding new source files or modules

If you add a new JavaScript file to an existing Lab module also add it to the associated section of the `MakeFile`.

For example if you created a pie chart grapher and intended it to be part of the mdoule
`lab.grapher.js` you might add the file here:

    src/lab/grapher/core/pie-chart.js

Then add that path to the `server/public/lab/lab.grapher.js` target section of the MakeFile:

    server/public/lab/lab.grapher.js: \
      src/lab/start.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/core.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/data.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/axis.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/indexed-data.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/graph.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/pie-chart.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/real-time-graph.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/colors.js \
      src/lab/grapher/core/register-keyboard-handler.js \
      src/lab/end.js

Similarly if you add a new module to Lab you will need to create a new target to represent the module
using a similar form to the `server/public/lab/lab.grapher.js` target as well as adding the target
module to the `LAB_JS_FILES` make variable containing the list of all Lab JavaScript modules to
be generated:

    LAB_JS_FILES = \
      server/public/lab/lab.grapher.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.benchmark.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.layout.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.views.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.arrays.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.molecules.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.energy2d.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.components.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.controllers.js \
      server/public/lab/lab.js

The html file are generated from [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) markup. Add the suffix `.html.haml`
to these files.

The css stylesheets are generated from [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) markup. Add the suffix `.sass` to these
files. The stylesheets may also be written using the newer `*.scss` variant of Sass.



### Generated Examples: `server/public/examples/`

The `server/public/examples/` directory is automatically generated running `make` and is not part of the repository.

When `bin/guard` is running any changes to files in the `src/examples/` directory cause automatic rebuilding
of the associated files in the `server/public/examples/` directory.

### HTML and CSS Generation

[Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) is used to generate most of the HTML in the `server/public/` directory.

[kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) is used to generate `readme.html` in `server/public/` from Mardown markup.

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is used to generate the CSS assets. The Sass markup may be in the form of
`*.sass` or `*.scss` files

The [Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/) library of Sass mixins is included.

## Testing: `test/`

Lab's JavaScript tests use [Vows](http://vowsjs.org), an asynchronous behavior driven framework based
on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). In addition Lab uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), a
lightweight CommonJS implementation of the W3C DOM specifications. Lab's test setup was inspired
by that used by [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/). The development dependencies for running the
tests are installed using [npm](http://npmjs.org/).

Running the tests:

    $ make test
    ................................. . . .. . . .
    x OK > 40 honored (0.012s)

If you are running `bin/guard` the tests run automatically anytime a change is made in the JavaScript
files in the `src/` or `test/` directory.

The results of the tests are displayed in the console that `bin/guard` is running in.

If the bottom of the console window is viewable you will see new test results whenever you save a changes.

Recent versions of nodejs/v8 support TypedArrays -- this make it possible to more extensively
test lab.arrays which is designed to support using either typed or regular arrays for computation.

`test/env.js` uses the node module [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to setup resources for
simple emulation of a browser.

[Vows](http://vowsjs.org) integrates the [standard nodejs assertions](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/assert.html)
with an additional collection of useful [assertions](http://vowsjs.org/#assertions) summarized below:

- numerical

        assert.greater (3, 2);
        assert.lesser (2, 3);
        assert.inDelta (Math.random(), 0, 1);

- equality

        assert.equal          (4, 4);
        assert.strictEqual    (4 > 2, true);
        assert.notEqual       (4, 2);
        assert.strictNotEqual (1, true);
        assert.deepEqual      ([4, 2], [4, 2]);
        assert.notDeepEqual   ([4, 2], [2, 4]);

- type

        assert.isFunction (function () {});
        assert.isObject   ({goo:true});
        assert.isString   ('goo');
        assert.isArray    ([4, 2]);
        assert.isNumber   (42);
        assert.isBoolean  (true);
        assert.typeOf     (42, 'number');
        assert.instanceOf ([], Array);

- truth

        assert.isTrue  (true);
        assert.isFalse (false);

- null, undefined, NaN

        assert.isNull      (null);
        assert.isNotNull   (undefined);
        assert.isUndefined ('goo'[9]);
        assert.isNaN       (0/0);

- inclusion

        assert.include ([4, 2, 0], 2);
        assert.include ({goo:true}, 'goo');
        assert.include ('goo', 'o');

- regexp matching

        assert.match ('hello', /^[a-z]+/);

- length

        assert.length ([4, 2, 0], 3);
        assert.length ('goo', 3);  *** not working ***

- emptiness

        assert.isEmpty ([]);
        assert.isEmpty ({});
        assert.isEmpty ("");

- exceptions

        assert.throws(function () { x + x }, ReferenceError);
        assert.doesNotThrow(function () { 1 + 1 }, Error);

Additionally `test/env-assert.js` has a number of useful additional assertions copied from
[d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/).

_**Note**: Using a more specific assertion usually results in more useful error reports._

There are also many interesting test examples and patterns in the
[d3.js test directory](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/tree/master/test) that can be adapted for use in Lab.

### A Simple Example of Test Driven Development

Here's a simple example that is part of the tests for `lab.arrays.js` to test the `arrays.max()` function:

    "find max in array with negative and positive numbers": function(max) {
      assert.equal(max([3, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]), 3);
    },

The 'model stepping' tests are a good example where the tests help helped drive new features. The basic
features I was testing in this section relate to the existing functionality exposed by the Stop, Start, Go, and
Reset buttons as wells as the extended keyboard controls that allow stepping forward and backwards a step at a time.

First I created this test that passed:

    "after running running one tick the model is at step 1": function(model) {
      model.tick();
      assert.equal(model.stepCounter(), 1);
      assert.isTrue(model.isNewStep());
    },

In thinking about driving out changes to KE, PE and Temperature of the molecular model itself I realized
I'd like the capability to run a specific number of steps forward and then check the results.

I then wrote this test that failed -- because the model.tick() function didn't yet take an optional argument to
run multiple steps forward:

    "after running 9 more ticks the model is at step 10": function(model) {
      model.tick(9);
      assert.equal(model.stepCounter(), 10);
      assert.isTrue(model.isNewStep());
    },

After saving the change I saw the new test failure reported in my console. I then implemented the new
feature in the actual `src/lab/molecules.js`. Less than a second after saving the file the tests
completed and the report showed it passing.

This is a very simple example -- but part of the value of this kind of test driven development is in first
thinking of how something should behave rather than in how to get it to actually do the work.

Since I already had this function for running one model step:

    model.tick()

Adding an optional numeric argument for running more steps is a fine way to express the intent of the new feature:

    model.tick(9)

In more complicated coding thinking about how to express the intent clearly and then what the result
should be if that intent is successful **FIRST** ... and then 'driving out' the actual implementation to
achieve that result can result in a better architecture -- and of course you also end up with tests.

Because the tests run SO quickly I can interactively change the code in the module or the test and
immediately see results.

### Debugging Tests using the node debugger

Sometimes it can be helpful to break into a debugger when there is a problem in either the code
or the test setup itself. Node comes with a [debugger](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/debugger.html)
which can be used in combination with vows and the tests.

First set a breakpoint by inserting the statement: `debugger;`

    suite.addBatch({
      "Thermometer": {
        topic: function() {
          debugger;
          return new components.Thermometer("#thermometer");
        },
        "creates thermometer": function(t) {
          assert.equal(t.max, 0.7)
        }
      }
    });

Start the node debugger and pass in the full command line to run the tests:

    node debug ./node_modules/vows/bin/vows --no-color

The debugger will break at the beginning of vows:

    < debugger listening on port 5858
    connecting... ok
    break in node_modules/vows/bin/vows:3
      1
      2
      3 var path   = require('path'),
      4     fs     = require('fs'),
      5     util   = require('util'),

Enter `cont` to continue execution until your breakpoint.

    debug> cont
    < ·
    < ········
    < ·
    <
    break in test/lab/components/components-test.js:13
     11   "Thermometer": {
     12     topic: function() {
     13       debugger;
     14       return new components.Thermometer("#thermometer");
     15     },

To evaluate expressions type `repl`  -- use ctrl-C to exit the repl:

    repl
    Press Ctrl + C to leave debug repl
    > initialization_options
    { model_listener: false,
      lennard_jones_forces: true,
      coulomb_forces: true }
    > atoms[0].charge
    -1

Enter **ctrl-C** to exit the repl and return to the debugger.

Enter **ctrl-D** to exit the debugger.

## Physical constants and units

The core of the molecular dynamics engine performs computations using dimensioned quantities; we do
not nondimensionalize to reduced units.  The units used internally are:

- femtoseconds
- nanometers
- Dalton (atomic mass units)
- elementary charges
- Kelvin

(Note that we will shortly switch to representing time in picoseconds rather than femtoseconds.)

The above implies that the 'natural' unit of energy within the application is the "Dalton nm^2 /
fs^2", and the natural unit of force is the "Dalton nm / fs^2". We call these "MW Energy Units" and
"MW Force Units" respectively; however, externally-facing methods accept and report energies in
electron volts, rather than "MW Units".

The molecular dynamics engine in `src/md-engine` contains a submodule, defined in `src/md-
engine/constants/` which defines physical useful constants and allows one to perform some unit
conversions in a mnemonic way.

Once you have `require()`d the constants module appropriately, you can access the constants, 2
converter methods, and an object that defines the various units. For the following, assume the
`constants` module has been `require()`d into the variable `constants`.

### Units

The various units are available as properties of the object `constants.unit`, and are named
appropriately. The units themselves are objects, but their properties are not external API; rather,
the unit objects are expected to be passed as arguments to conversion methods which return numeric
values. Units are named in the singular and are written as all-uppercase (they are constants).

Some example units are:

- `constants.unit.JOULE` constants.unit.MW_ENERGY_UNIT` (Dalton nm^2 / fs^2, see above)
- `constants.unit.METERS_PER_FARAD`

### Physical Constants

The various constants are defined as properties of the `constants` object. However, these do not
have numerical values; instead, they each contain a single method, `as`, which accepts a unit (see
above) and returns the numerical value of that constant in terms of that unit. This is intended to
be a convenience for the programmer and to reduce the likelihood that he or she will forget to keep
track of the units in which a value is stored.

For example,

- `constants.BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT.as(constants.unit.JOULES_PER_KELVIN)` (== 1.380658e-23)
- `constants.PERMITTIVITY_OF_FREE_SPACE.as(constants.unit.FARADS_PER_METER)` (== 8.854187e-12)

### Unit conversions

The `constants` module does not attempt to do dimensional analysis (for example, converting kg m/s^2
into Newtons). However, it can convert a value between two different units that measure the same
type of quantity, and it can supply conversion ratios that make it easier to do dimensional analysis
carefully in your own code.


#### Converting a value between two unit types:

To convert the value 1kg into Daltons (aka atomic mass units), use the `convert` method:

`constants.convert(1, { from: constants.unit.KILOGRAM, to: constants.unit.DALTON })` (==
6.022137376997844e+26)

#### Finding the ratio between two unit types and rolling your own unit conversions:

To find the number of atomic masses in 1 kg, use the `ratio` method with the `per` argument:

`constants.ratio(constants.unit.DALTON, { per: constants.unit.KILOGRAM })`
(== 6.022137376997844e+26)

This form of ratio is especially useful for unit conversion, and the "per" is intended as a
mnemonic. The number reported above, for example, is easily understood to be "6.022 x 10^26 Dalton
per kilogram" and can therefore be used as a factor that "cancels" kilograms and replaces them with
Daltons in a compound unit such as "kg m/s".

However, sometimes you want the value of a Dalton expressed as kilograms. Although you *could*
reverse the units in the above function call, or divide 1 by the result above, it is better to use
the mnemonic `as` form of `ratio`:

`constants.ratio(constants.unit.DALTON, { as: constants.unit.KILOGRAM })` (== 1.66054e-27)

## Deployment

### Deploying static content to a Github gh-pages branch

Github's [github:pages](http://pages.github.com/) feature supports sharing any content in
a `gh-pages` repository branch as static web content.

The [gh-pages branch of the Lab repository](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab/tree/gh-pages)
is used to store the static pages and client-side code built by the Makefile at the directory `server/public`.

  [concord-consortium.github.com/lab](http://concord-consortium.github.com/lab/)

In addition the content of the `gh-pages` branch is used to create the
[downloadable archive distributions of Lab](#distribution-of-project-and-examples)

The contents of the
gh-pages branch are automatically made available in a standard web-page form (as opposed to the standard Github
page for showing a repository) at this url:

  [concord-consortium.github.com/lab](http://concord-consortium.github.com/lab/)

   when you push to the gh-pages branch.

If you maintain a fork of this project on Github, you get a Github Page for free, and the
instructions below apply to you as well!

#### Making the `server/public/` folder track the gh-pages branch

If you haven't done this yet, make the `server/public` folder track the contents of the gh-pages branch.

**If you have a `Guard` process running make sure and stop it before continuing!**

    # server/public/ needs to be empty for git clone to be happy:
    rm -rf server/public

    # substitute the URL for whatever fork of the Lab repository you have write access to:
    git clone git@github.com:concord-consortium/lab.git -b gh-pages server/public

Note that `make clean` now empties the `server/public` folder in-place, leaving the Git
`server/public/.git` and `server/public/jnlp` directories intact.

#### Pushing changes to gh-pages branch

First, make sure your `server/public` folder tracks the gh-pages branch, as per the above.

Then run the following shell command in the `script/` folder:

    script/gh-pages

This script will first make sure there is nothing that isn't committed. If
there are unstaged or staged and uncommitted files the `gh-pages` script will halt.

Test and commit (or save the changes to a topic branch) and if your testing show
the bugs are fixed or the new features or examples are stable then push
these changes to the master branch and try running the `gh-pages` script again:

    git push origin master
    script/gh-pages

### Deploying to a remote server

The Lab project has a suite of scripts for creating and deploying to EC2 servers running
on Amazon Web services (AWS).

The scripts for creating, stopping and re-creating a server require an AWS account. These scrpts use
the Ruby proge

The Capistrano scripts for updating a deployment to an existing server only require that you have a copy of
the pem file associated

To deploy to AWS you will need an AWS account and the ability to create and modify EC2 instances.

If you are create a new server from scratch you will also need access to the AWS DNS service Route53.

**Note: currently there are a few steps/resources that only work properly if you have a concord.org
AWS account.**

#### AWS Setup/Prerequisites

1.  AWS account. For deployment to the lab servers managed by CC you will need an AWS
    account managed by concord.org.
2.  Copy your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key to the following yaml configuration
    file `.fog` in your home directory:

        :default:
          :aws_access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          :aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

3.  Place a copy of a the appropriate AWS PEM file on your local files system. For deployment
    to the lab servers managed by CC use the `lab-dev` pem.
4.  Create or identify an appropriate AWS security group. For deployment to the lab servers managed
    by CC the `lab.dev` security group is used.
5.  Edit the `:deploy` section of `config/config.yml` using values in `config/config_sample.yml`
    as a guide.
    
    Here's an example from the `:deploy` section of a working `config.yml`:

        :deploy:
          :targets:
          - :name: lab-dev
            :url: lab.dev.concord.org
            :branch: master
          :group_name: lab.dev
          :zone_domain: concord.org.
          :zone_records_name: dev.concord.org
          :pem:
            :name: lab-dev
            :path: ~/.ec2

    There is one deploy target named `lab-dev` associated with a server running at `lab.dev.concord.org`.
    Deployments to `lab-dev` use the master branch of the repository. The `lab.dev` security group is
    used when new servers are created or existing sever are re-created.
    
    When a whole new server is created the DNS entry is created in the `concord.org.` zone domain and
    when searching for an existing DNS entry for a `deploy-target` the zone record name `dev.concord.org`
    is used.
    
    Besides the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key security credentials copyied locally to
    to the file `~/.fog` the `lab-dev.pem` file saved in the directory: `~/.ec2` is also used when
    communicating with AWS.
6.  List the deploy targets described in `config/config.yml` with the task: `thor cloud:list_targets`
    to confirm the configuration is valid:

        $ thor cloud:list_targets

          Deploy Targets
          name                    url                           branch
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          lab-dev                 lab.dev.concord.org           master

7.  Generate specific Capistrano deploy tasks and littlechef nodes using `deploy-targets`
    specified in `config/config.yml`. Run this `thor` task whenever you change the `:deploy`
    section in `config/config.yml` to generate the Ruby Capastrano configuration files in
    `config/deployment/<deploy-target>.rb` and the littlechef JSON configurations in
    `config/littlechef/nodes/<deploy-target>.json`

        $ thor cloud:setup

8.  List the running AWS server instances to confirm that your local AWS security credentials
    are setup correctly:

        $ thor cloud:list

          target              hostname                      state         ipaddress           ec2-id          ec2-dns
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          lab-dev             lab.dev.concord.org.          running       107.22.184.173      i-f844ec81      ec2-107-22-184-173.compute-1.amazonaws.com

### Using Capstrano to deploy new code to an existing server

After testing, committing, and pushing code to a public repository use the Capistrano
tasks to update a remote server.

The capistrano commands take the form:

    cap <deploy-target> task

The basic command to update a server:

    can <deploy-taget> deploy:update

Here are the list of current Capistrano deploy commands:

    $ cap -T deploy:
    cap deploy:clean_and_update # clean and update server
    cap deploy:setup            # setup server
    cap deploy:update           # update server
    cap deploy:update_jnlps     # update public/jnlp dir on server

Update the `lab.dev.concord.org` server with the latest code committed on the master branch on
[concord-consortium/lab](https://github.com/concord-consortium/lab}):

    cap lab-dev deploy:update

When you have made changes in the repository like adding or updating a git submodule in
`src/vendor` then you will need instead run the `deploy:clean_and_update` task:

    cap lab-dev deploy:clean_and_update

### Updating the Java jar resources on a remote rerver

The Java resources require much less frequent updates since the main body of work
for Lab is occuriring in the HTML5 development.

The capistrano task: `deploy:update_jnlps` erases the `server/public/jnlp/`
directory on the remote server and re-generates and deploy the packed signed
jars from source or from downloads:

    $ cap <deploy-target> deploy:update_jnlps

The resulting directory on the server will look something like this:

    $ tree /var/www/app/server/public/jnlp/
    server/public/jnlp/

### Managing AWS servers with thor tasks

There are a set of [thor](#thor) tasks for managing, creating, and re-creating AWS servers for Lab:

    $ thor -T
    cloud
    -----
    thor cloud:create (hostname)    # create a new server instance using this hostname
    thor cloud:delete (hostname)    # delete an existing server instance running at this hostname
    thor cloud:list                 # list existing servers
    thor cloud:list_targets         # list existing deploy targets
    thor cloud:recreate (hostname)  # recreate a new server instance for this hostname by destroying and rebuilding an existing server
    thor cloud:setup                # setup capistrano deploy tasks and littlechef nodes using targets in config/config.yml
    thor cloud:start (ec2_id)       # start a stopped existing server instance at this hostname
    thor cloud:stop (hostname)      # stop a running existing server instance at this hostname

There is more work to do to generalize these deployment systems to work with multiple servers.

Create a new Amazon EC2 instance as described in the readme in the **ruby-lab-server** branch in
Concord Consortium's [littlechef-servers](https://github.com/concord-consortium/littlechef-servers)
repository. Make sure the security group you choose has port 80 open.

Modify the value of the `:host` key in the configuration file `config/config.yml` to reference
the domain name of the new server.

    $ cap <deploy-target> deploy:setup

Will do an initial deploy and build of all the project resources to the server.
