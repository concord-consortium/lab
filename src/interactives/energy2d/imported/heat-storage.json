  "about": "In the following model, two balls of the same size but of different\nthermal masses are put in different compartments separate by a thermal\ninsulator in the middle. The balls are heated up by shining a light onto\nthem. The light incidents from the upright position and gives an equal\namount of energy to the balls. Start the simulation and wait until the\ntwo thermometers read the same temperature. Then turn off the light.\nSelect \\\"Graph\\\" to see the changes of temperature readings from the\nthermometers.\n\nWhile the simulation is running, turn on the temperature graph. Turn the\nlight on and off several times. If you were to choose from the above two\nmaterials to build a wall of a house, which one would you use?\n\n**Important Note:** Light radiation from the hot plate is represented by\na limited number of rays, each of which travels at a much slower speed\nthan the speed of light. This is a computational approximation that does\nnot reflect the nature of light energy.   \n{: style=\"clear: both;\"}\n\n",
