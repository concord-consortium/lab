  "about": "A Trombe wall is a sun-facing wall separated from the outdoors by glass\nand an air space, which absorbs solar energy and releases it into the\nhouse through a convective air loop. It consists a solar absorber (often\npainted black) and two vents for air to circulate and carry the solar\nheat. The following simulation shows this.\n\nRight-click these links to download the models:  \n [trombe-wall.e2d](e2d/trombe-wall.e2d),\n[trombe-wall-closeup.e2d](e2d/trombe-wall-closeup.e2d)\n{: align=\"center\"}\n\n",
