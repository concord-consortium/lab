  "about": "Both conduction and convection happen in fluids. As heat transfer\nthrough both processes reduces the temperature difference, they can be\nconsidered as competing against each other in transferring heat. There\nare many different types of fluids, such as air, water, oil, or mercury.\nThe rates of conduction and convection vary in different fluids.\nSometimes, conduction dominates. Other times, convection dominates. The\nPrandtl number is a parameter that can be used to roughly determine\nwhich process will \\\"win\\\":\n\nPr=ν/α\n{: .formula}\n\nwhere *ν* is the kinematic viscosity and *α* is the thermal diffusivity.\nIf a fluid is more viscous (sticky), the Prandtl number is greater and\nthe heat transfer will be more conductive.\n\nThe following simulation shows how fluids with different Prandtl numbers\ntransfer heat.\n\n",
