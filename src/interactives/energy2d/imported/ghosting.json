  "about": "You may observe dark areas in interior walls in some old buildings. In\nthe old days people did not understand what caused them. So they\nsuspected that those might be ghosts living in old buildings. Today we\nknow they are caused by the effect of thermal bridging on steer framing\n(colder areas tend to have more water vapor condensation, which\nfacilitates mold growth that makes the areas look dark, like ghost\nshadows). The following simulations show this effect and how to avoid\nit.\n\nRight-click these links to download the models:  \n [ghosting.e2d](e2d/ghosting.e2d),\n[no-ghosting.e2d](e2d/no-ghosting.e2d)\n{: align=\"center\"}\n\n",
