  "about": "This simulation illustrates the accuracy of our heat solver by testing\nhow well it observes the Law of Conservation of Energy (aka the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics). The following model simulates a completely\ninsulative system (i.e., no heat in, no heat out) using a thermal\nboundary of zero heat flux. As you can see, as the time step increases,\nthe precision decreases. But a small time step (0.01s) is capable of\nmaintaining the total thermal energy at a level as accurate as\n**99.99%** for as long as the simulation runs, regardless of the\ncomplexity of the structures in the system!\n\n",
