  "subtitle": "How should you configure different layers for a wall for better insulation?",
  "about": "In this model, three layers (labeled as \\\"A\\\", \\\"B\\\", and \\\"C\\\") that\nhave different thermal conductivities fill the space between the heater\nand an object. **Your challenge is to find out which layer has the\ngreatest thermal conductivity and which has the lowest by running a\nsequence of tests for different layer configurations.**\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the four\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n4.  Change the order of the layers using the drop-down menu to test a\n    different setup.\n5.  Repeat the above steps until you reach the conclusion.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
