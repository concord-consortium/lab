  "about": "You can select one of two houses, A and B, which have identical shape as\nshown in the model but different quality of construction. The yellow\nobject in the middle of the house is a heater. Unlike the previous\nmodels, the temperature coloring is initially turned off. You may turn\nit on using the \\\"Heat map\\\" radio button if it helps your diagnosis.\n\n**Your task is to find which house requires higher power to heat.** Try\nto maintain a temperature near the window at about 20°C. Note that the\nheater has two power levels and can also be turned off and on as the\nmodel runs. Turn on the graph to observe the temperatures recorded by\nthe thermometers.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
