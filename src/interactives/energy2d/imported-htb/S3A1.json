  "about": "In this model, you will compare heat conduction through four different\ntypes of materials: metal, stone, fiberglass, and wood.\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the four\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary. Click on a thermometer to highlight\n    its data.\n4.  Wait until the temperatures do not change any further.\n5.  In which material does heat flow the fastest? Answer the questions\n    in your workbook.\n\nIn the following sections, we will study all the factors that affect the\nrate of heat conduction.\n\n",
