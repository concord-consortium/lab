  "about": "In this model, there are three test pieces made of materials that have\ndifferent thermal conductivities and heat capacities. **Your task is to\nfind out which material is the best insulator.**\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the three\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n4.  Choose \\\"Thermal energy\\\" from the \\\"Heat map\\\" drop-down list to\n    switch the view from temperature distribution to thermal energy\n    distribution. In the thermal energy view, you will see where the\n    energy goes.\n\nAfter you observe the model, answer the questions in your workbook.\n\n",
