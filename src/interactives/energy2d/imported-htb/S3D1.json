Run the model until it stops.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the change of the temperature if\n    necessary.\n3.  In the workbook, write down the temperature of the heater and the\n    temperature of the thermometer when the model stops.\n4.  Use the drop-down menu below the model to change the heater\n    temperature.\n5.  Repeat 1-3 for two more different heater temperatures.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
