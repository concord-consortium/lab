    "The type of bond is determined by valence electron count of the atoms that are reacting.",
    "E.g. when both atoms have only 1 valence electron, they can form only a single bond.",
    "Atoms that have between 2 and 6 valence electrons can also form a double bond. Finally atoms",
    "that have between 3 and 5 valence electrons can form a triple bond too. The bond type choice",
    "is based on a probabilistic approach (see *bondProbability* option). The default values cause",
    "that it's most likely that a single bond will be formed (80% for single, 15% for double and",
    "5% chances for triple bond).",
    "",
    "Of course the bond type is also determined by the minimum free slots count of both atoms.",
    "So when one atom can form a double bond, but the second atom could form only a single bond,",
    "the single bond will be created.",
    "",
    "If an atom still have a free slot after forming a bond, it can create a bond again during",
    "another chemical reaction."
