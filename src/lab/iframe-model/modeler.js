    /*
    Options for starting on property support:
    - add a hard-coded outputProperty that reads from a cached value, and start a timer to trigger
      the method that notifies all outputProperty listereners
    - add a hard-coded parameter, that we update based on a property listener

    Possible next steps:
    - make paramaters, outputProperties, or mainProperties be more dynamic so they are 'defined'
      in the iframe-model json definition.
    - create a way for the iframe'd html to send the property definition, which the model then uses
      to add the properties to itself. This will keep the properties in the same place as the model
      and possible enable the model to more easily be used in a different container other than Lab.

    Possible problems:
    - properites will need to be 'cached' in the interactive window, so that getters will work. the
      property system already has support for caching. But it means that all properties are going to
      have to be sent 'over the wire' whenever they are changed inorder for getters to work. If
      the model json or interactive defines which properties are needed then this might not be a problem,
      but if the properties are provided by the iframe'd html, it won't know what is needed so it will
      send all properties.
