    "content": "The lid-driven cavity flow involves a fluid in a square box driven by constant \"blow\" near the lid. \nDepending on the physical conditions, a stable eddy can form within the box (as shown by the streamlines).\nYou may notice that when a stable eddy occupies the entire box, its center is actually cooler than the edge, \nindicating the faster heat transfer rate through forced convection than through conduction.\nThe lid-driven cavity problem is one of the most important benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics.",
