    "content": "Energy (Q) and power (P) are related by Q = Pt.\nThis means the longer (t) you turn on a heater, the more heat (Q) it will produce. \nAnd the higher the power (P) is, the more heat (Q) it will produce.\n\nTwo identical, closed boxes each have a round heater at the center, with the power output as labeled.\nInstructions: 1) Run the model and turn the graph on to monitor the temperatures; \n2) Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to rescale the curves if necessary;\n3) Calculate the ratio of the temperatures measured by the two thermometers in the two boxes \nand compare it with the ratio of the heating powers.",
